# THE SHIT - Jordan's Perfect Daily Workflow

## Morning Routine
```bash
# Start the day
ðŸ’© morning
# â†’ Starts focus timer (25min)
# â†’ Plays morning focus playlist
# â†’ Shows git status across all repos
# â†’ Lists today's PRs to review
# â†’ Shows overnight CI failures
# â†’ Displays Conduit component updates

# Quick status check
ðŸ’© status
# â†’ Active Claude instances (orchestration status)
# â†’ Current branch + uncommitted changes
# â†’ Running tests/builds
# â†’ Focus time today
# â†’ Active Spotify track
```

## Core Development Flow (Conduit/Laravel)

### Working with Claude Orchestration
```bash
# Start coding session with multiple Claudes
ðŸ’© orchestrate "implement new Docker component"
# â†’ Spins up 3 Claude instances
# â†’ Assigns roles (architect, implementer, tester)
# â†’ Prevents file conflicts
# â†’ Tracks progress in real-time

# Check Claude conflicts before committing
ðŸ’© claude:conflicts
# â†’ Shows which files are being edited by which Claude
# â†’ Prevents commit disasters

# Hand off work between sessions
ðŸ’© claude:handoff "continue the Docker implementation"
# â†’ Captures current state
# â†’ Generates context for next Claude
# â†’ Preserves knowledge
```

### Conduit Component Development
```bash
# Quick component scaffold
ðŸ’© component:new github-actions
# â†’ Scaffolds full component structure
# â†’ Sets up GitHub repo
# â†’ Initializes with Jordan's defaults
# â†’ Creates initial tests

# Test component in isolation
ðŸ’© component:test github-actions
# â†’ Runs component's test suite
# â†’ Validates manifest
# â†’ Checks integration points

# Release component
ðŸ’© component:release github-actions
# â†’ Runs tests
# â†’ Bumps version
# â†’ Creates GitHub release
# â†’ Updates main Conduit registry
```

### Knowledge Management (Critical for AI Context)
```bash
# Capture solution for future Claudes
ðŸ’© knowledge:capture "Fixed Laravel Zero command registration by..."
# â†’ Saves to Conduit knowledge base
# â†’ Tags automatically (Laravel, debugging, etc.)
# â†’ Available to all future Claude sessions

# Search knowledge before debugging
ðŸ’© knowledge:search "command not found"
# â†’ Searches all captured knowledge
# â†’ Shows relevant solutions
# â†’ Includes context from when it was solved
```

### Smart Git Workflow
```bash
# AI-powered commits (but YOUR style)
ðŸ’© commit
# â†’ Analyzes changes
# â†’ Generates commit message in Jordan's style
# â†’ NO Claude attribution (as per your rules)
# â†’ Follows conventional commits

# Quick PR creation
ðŸ’© pr
# â†’ Creates PR with generated description
# â†’ Links to relevant issues
# â†’ Adds reviewers based on files changed
# â†’ Posts to Slack/Discord

# Daily standup helper
ðŸ’© standup
# â†’ Yesterday's commits
# â†’ Today's planned work (from brain)
# â†’ Any blockers
# â†’ Formats for Slack
```

## Focus & Productivity

```bash
# Deep work mode
ðŸ’© focus:deep
# â†’ 90min timer (not 25)
# â†’ Blocks Slack/Discord
# â†’ Sets Spotify to instrumental
# â†’ Sets commit message prefix to "ðŸŽ¯ focused:"

# Context switching
ðŸ’© context:switch pstrax
# â†’ Stashes current changes
# â†’ Switches to Pstrax repos
# â†’ Loads Pstrax-specific env vars
# â†’ Shows Pstrax PR reviews needed

ðŸ’© context:switch conduit
# â†’ Back to Conduit work
# â†’ Restores stashed changes
# â†’ Loads Conduit env
```

## AI Brain That Actually Works

```bash
# Natural language that understands YOUR context
ðŸ’© brain "fix the delegation issue"
# â†’ Knows you mean ComponentServiceProvider
# â†’ Searches your knowledge base first
# â†’ Checks recent commits for context
# â†’ Actually fixes it or shows how

ðŸ’© brain "ship the Docker component"
# â†’ Runs tests
# â†’ Fixes any issues
# â†’ Commits with your style
# â†’ Creates PR
# â†’ Updates component registry

ðŸ’© brain "what was I working on yesterday"
# â†’ Checks git commits
# â†’ Reviews Claude orchestration logs
# â†’ Shows focus sessions
# â†’ Summarizes in bullet points
```

## End of Day

```bash
# Wrap up
ðŸ’© eod
# â†’ Commits any uncommitted work to WIP branch
# â†’ Logs work to Conduit journal
# â†’ Shows tomorrow's calendar
# â†’ Kills any running Claude instances
# â†’ Posts summary to team Slack

# Weekend mode

## Why This Would Actually Work for Jordan

1. **Orchestration-First**: Built around managing multiple Claude instances
2. **Knowledge Capture**: Every solution saved for future sessions
3. **Context Aware**: Knows about Conduit, Pstrax, Laravel Zero
4. **Focus on Flow**: 90min blocks, not pomodoro
5. **Real Integration**: Spotify + Git + Claude + Slack
6. **Jordan's Style**: Commits without Claude attribution
7. **Liberation Philosophy**: Components stay standalone

This isn't a generic tool - it's Jordan's personal command center.
