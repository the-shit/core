# Why Tests Fail

Testing is hard! Here are common reasons:

## Common Failures
- Missing dependencies
- Wrong assumptions about file paths
- Database not initialized
- Permissions issues

## THE SHIT Testing Philosophy
Components should be tested in isolation with:
- Unit tests for logic
- Integration tests for database
- E2E tests for full workflow
