# AI Component Analysis

## Overview
The AI component in THE SHIT provides multi-model orchestration with specialized capabilities for different tasks.

## Model Specialization

### GPT-5 (Experimental)
- **Models**: gpt-5, gpt-5-mini, gpt-5-nano
- **Status**: Experimental but working
- **Best For**:
  - Quick validation tasks
  - Embeddings generation
  - Lightweight operations
  - Testing new AI capabilities
- **Limitations**:
  - Fixed temperature at 1.0
  - Uses `max_completion_tokens` instead of `max_tokens`
  - No `top_p` support

### Grok (xAI)
- **Models**: grok-2-1212, grok-3, grok-4-0709
- **Best For**:
  - Deep code analysis
  - Framework understanding
  - Architecture analysis
  - Complex reasoning
- **Used In**: `analyze` command for framework analysis

### Claude
- **Models**: claude-3-5-sonnet, claude-3-opus
- **Best For**:
  - Extended reasoning
  - Implementation guidance
  - Documentation generation
  - Complex problem solving

## Architecture Insights

### Event-Driven Intelligence
Every AI interaction emits events to `events.jsonl`:
- `ai.conversation` - Full conversation tracking
- `ai.models.listed` - Model availability checks
- `ai.framework.analyzed` - Deep analysis events
- Token usage and performance metrics included

### Service Architecture
```
AIService
├── Chat methods for each provider
├── Event emission
├── Token tracking
└── Performance monitoring
```

## Commands

### Core Commands
- `ask` - General AI queries (provider agnostic)
- `analyze` - Deep analysis using Grok
- `gpt5` - Direct GPT-5 interaction
- `models` - List available models
- `generate` - Code generation
- `review` - Code review

## Integration with Knowledge System

The AI component should integrate with knowledge capture:
1. Every analysis creates knowledge entities
2. Conversations are logged as events
3. Insights are captured for future reference

## Next Steps
- [ ] Create embedding service for all AI conversations
- [ ] Auto-generate notes from AI analysis
- [ ] Build knowledge graph from interactions
