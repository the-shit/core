# Obsidian-Bridge Component Creation Log

## Component Scaffold Created
**Time**: Sprint 1, Day 1
**Location**: `/Users/jordanpartridge/packages/the-shit/ðŸ’©-components/obsidian-bridge`

### Initial Setup
- âœ… Used `php ðŸ’© component:scaffold obsidian-bridge` command
- âœ… Component successfully created with Laravel Zero structure
- âœ… Updated ðŸ’©.json manifest with proper commands and metadata

### Manifest Configuration
```json
{
    "name": "obsidian-bridge",
    "shit_acronym": "Synchronized Harmonious Information Transfer",
    "commands": {
        "obsidian:sync": "Bi-directional synchronization",
        "obsidian:search": "Semantic search",
        "obsidian:generate": "AI-powered generation",
        "obsidian:watch": "Real-time monitoring",
        "obsidian:graph": "Graph visualization",
        "obsidian:serve": "REST API server"
    }
}
```

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks
1. Create database migrations for SQLite schema
2. Implement command classes in `app/Commands/`
3. Set up ObsidianService for core functionality
4. Configure database connection in config

### Directory Structure Created
```
ðŸ’©-components/obsidian-bridge/
â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ’©.json                 # Component manifest
â”œâ”€â”€ component              # Executable entry point
â”œâ”€â”€ app/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Commands/         # Command implementations
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Services/         # Business logic
â”œâ”€â”€ config/               # Configuration files
â”œâ”€â”€ database/             # Migrations and seeds
â”œâ”€â”€ storage/              # Local storage for DB
â””â”€â”€ tests/                # Test suites
```

## Integration Points Identified

### 1. Event System
- Will emit events to `storage/events.jsonl`
- Subscribe to AI component events
- Track all sync operations

### 2. AI Component
- Use GPT-5 for embeddings
- Leverage Grok for analysis
- Generate notes from AI conversations

### 3. Database Design
- SQLite with FTS5 for full-text search
- Vector embeddings as BLOBs
- JSON columns for flexible metadata

## Technical Decisions Made

1. **SQLite over PostgreSQL**: Maintains component independence
2. **JSONL for events**: Consistent with THE SHIT patterns
3. **Markdown parsing**: Using League/CommonMark for reliability
4. **Command naming**: Simple `obsidian:action` pattern per THE SHIT philosophy

## Development Environment

### Requirements Verified
- PHP 8.2+ âœ“
- Laravel Zero 11.x âœ“
- Composer 2.x âœ“
- SQLite 3.35+ âœ“

### Dependencies to Install
```bash
cd ðŸ’©-components/obsidian-bridge
composer require league/commonmark
composer require --dev pestphp/pest
```

## Component Philosophy Alignment

This component embodies THE SHIT's liberation philosophy:
- **Independent**: Own database, no shared dependencies
- **Event-driven**: Communicates via events
- **Simple commands**: One argument max, no complex flags
- **AI-powered**: Leverages multiple AI models
- **Human-centric**: Bridges AI knowledge to human-readable Obsidian

## Risks and Mitigations

### Risk: Large Obsidian Vaults
**Mitigation**: Implement incremental sync with checksums

### Risk: Embedding API Costs
**Mitigation**: Aggressive caching, batch processing

### Risk: Sync Conflicts
**Mitigation**: Version tracking, manual review option

## Success Criteria

1. Can sync 1000 notes in under 10 seconds
2. Search returns results in < 100ms
3. Zero data loss during sync operations
4. Seamless integration with existing Obsidian workflow

## Questions for Next Session

1. Should we support multiple vault configurations?
2. How to handle Obsidian plugins that modify content?
3. Should embeddings be generated locally or via API?
4. What's the priority: speed or accuracy for search?
